## Description

This application is a simple to-do list application. The user is given time blocks for a typical 9 - 5 work day, and each block can be filled with tasks, or notes for each hour block. When the save button is clicked the input will be saved into local storage so it can be saved for that day. Each block will be color coordinated depending on what time it is. Gray for past, red for present, and green for future. Use this application to be as productive as you can be with your work day!
